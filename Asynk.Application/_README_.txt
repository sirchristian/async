Here are some quick start instructions (your mileage may vary)

   1. Add a reference to Asynk.Library to your application
   2. Add the AsynkCallable attribute to any method you want Asynk to call.
   3. Change the caller to your method to call Asynker.Process instead.
   4. Make sure Asynk.exe can access your dll's (either in the GAC or in the same director as Asynk.exe)
   5. Install Asynk.exe as a service (by running Asynk.exe /install) or run Asynk.exe from the console by running Asynk.exe /debug
